# Kmean-for-student-learning-abilities

A Project for Data Cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and Clustering.

## Overview
This project involves cleaning and analyzing a dataset, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), and applying machine learning techniques such as clustering and dimensionality reduction. This work provides insights into data preparation, visualization, and model evaluation processes.

## Features
- **Data Cleaning**: Prepares raw data for analysis by handling missing values and anomalies.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Provides insights into the data through summary statistics and visualizations.
- **Data Standardization**: Ensures that all features contribute equally to the model by scaling them appropriately.
- **Clustering and Dimensionality Reduction**: Uses machine learning algorithms to group similar data points and reduce feature dimensions.

## Technologies Used
The project leverages the following Python libraries:
- **pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **numpy**: For numerical computations.
- **matplotlib** and **seaborn**: For creating informative visualizations.
- **scikit-learn**:
  - `sklearn.cluster`: For clustering algorithms.
  - `sklearn.decomposition`: For dimensionality reduction techniques.
  - `sklearn.preprocessing`: For data scaling and normalization.
  - `sklearn.metrics`: For evaluating model performance.
